# tmux-config

My configuration for tmux.

It is based on the configuration by Maksym Komar that remaps tmux keybindings to use [`screen`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) keybindings.


## Setup

In the home directory `~`, create a symbolic link `.tmux.conf` pointing to the file `tmux.conf` in this directory.
